# -Investigate-a-Dataset---Udacity-Nano-Degree

# Conclusion:

After exploring the dataset, I found the following observation and trends related to other factors for patients not showing up for their scheduled appointment.

We started our analysis with Research Question 1 : Relationship between "Gender" & "No-Show" : Who visits the doctor more often?? and we found that Females are more likely to visit the hospital than men after doing analysis between females & males

What is the proportion of group not showing up for the appointment?? The female and younger take up mainly the ‘no-show’ group,but woman and men have a similar no-showing proportion

We didn't found any relevant aspect that can bring a consistent insight by analysing SMS received factor, Only that patients that have received sms have they're no-show rate increased in ~10% related to patients that haven't received any reminder

The no-showing rate of age decresases as older the person is. It reaches higher rates when the patient is a baby and the lowest rates when the patient is above 90 years old.

# Limitation:

# Study and conclusions are limited by the analysis of data:

As we saw in the "Age" column, there were negative age present which we had to drop before starting our analysis, may be because they have taken incorrectly because negative age is practically not possible.
Also, in the handicapped column, there were 5 different levels of handicapped values present. I assumed just 0 & 1 level and ignored other level, this might affect our analysis.
In AppointmentDay column there were only date present and time data was missing unlike ScheduledDay, we might have done some better analysis by comparing both date and time data.
